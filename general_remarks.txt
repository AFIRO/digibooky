No logic in controllers ++
Good code
Tests ++

My #1 take-away: Codereview eachothers code (or your own code)

sometimes a little more complex than needed

it was visible to me the code is written by multiple people
* inconsistent if/else syntax
* collection vs list

do not be afraid to create your own exceptions

I did not CR your tests
at first glance:
No tests for Lending
+ you can make your lifes easier sometimes using AssertJ (vs JUnit)
